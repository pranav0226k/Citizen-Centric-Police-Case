# Citizen-Centric-Police-Case
I’ll first build a mini project demonstrating a citizen case-tracking system using mock data. Then I’ll extend it into a data engineering and analytics pipeline, and finally build ML models to predict case delays and resolution time using synthetic data. This way, the project evolves from a system design problem into a data science problem.

# Problem-Statement: 
Citizen-Centric Police Case Tracking System with Analytics & Prediction (PoC)

# Objective:
To design and implement a secure, citizen-friendly web portal that allows users to track high-level police case progress.
The system will later be extended to perform data engineering, analytics, and machine learning on synthetic case data to predict case delays and resolution time.

# MVP:
INCLUDED (Do only this now):
---------------------------
-Citizen login (OTP – mock)

-FIR / Complaint lookup

-Case progress timeline (static stages)

-Document upload (mock storage)

-Admin/Police view to update case status

-Dashboard showing case status

NOT INCLUDED (Future Phase):
---------------------------
-Real police data

-Real-time court APIs

-Facial recognition / surveillance

-Crime prediction of individuals
