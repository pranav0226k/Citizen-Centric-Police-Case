# Citizen-Centric-Police-Case
I’ll first build a mini project demonstrating a citizen case-tracking system using mock data. Then I’ll extend it into a data engineering and analytics pipeline, and finally build ML models to predict case delays and resolution time using synthetic data. This way, the project evolves from a system design problem into a data science problem.
